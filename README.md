# Hi I'm Kevin McDaniel

### Tech Stuff:
Iâ€™m a front end developer, itâ€™s what I do, itâ€™s what I love. I cut my teeth on web design back in the days of table based design and progressed to CSS and on to responsive design. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of CSS frameworks like bootstrap, but I can work with them. I can use CSS preprocessors and write my own mixins. I can use vanilla JavaScript as easily as jQuery and use other libraries as the need arises.

### Industry Stuff:
17 years in the industry means I know all the standard stuff; like Agile and Scrum, git, CI/CD, task runners and bundlers. I can communicate with business owners, project managers, designers and developers.

### Other stuff: 
I can design. Itâ€™s not something I do a lot of, but I understand the principles of good UX and can make mockups, design elements and intuitive interface designs. If thereâ€™s data in a table, I can usually pull it out. Maybe not as efficiently as a dba, but I can at least get to it. If thereâ€™s a problem in server side code, I can monkey around and massage things to make it work, or communicate to the back end team exactly where and what the problem is.

### Learning Stuff:
In this industry if you don't keep learing you'll get left behind. Iâ€™ve spent the majority of my working career in the same technology stack and was frustrated that my skills were stagnating. Burnout was setting in and I knew it was time for a change. Iâ€™m currently progressing my React skills from boot camp level to professional level. I would love to weave more UX work into my career.

### Hobbie Stuff:

Iâ€™m also an avid backpacker having hiked the majority of the Pacific Crest Trail, the entire Colorado Trail as well as countless weekend adventures around the PNW. I have a small YouTube channel I use to document my adventures. Iâ€™m a gamer and a tinkerer, reader and writer.

Tl;dr I do web stuff.
